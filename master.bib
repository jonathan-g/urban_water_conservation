  Abstract                 = {The New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) Scale, published in The Journal of Environmental Education by R. E. Dunlap and K. D. Van Liere (1978), has become the most widely used measure of environmental concern in the world and been employed in hundreds of studies in dozens of nations. This article tells the story of the NEP Scale, beginning with how the author developed the notion of an environmental paradigm and then decided to measure it. The author describes the original NEP Scale and its 3 revisions, 1 of which is rapidly replacing the 1978 version in most studies. The author then reviews current uses of the various NEP Scales and examines major criticisms of them. Last, the author discusses the failure of an ecological worldview to become institutionalized in the United States, stemming from intense opposition to it since the 1990s, and the need to understand the sources of this opposition and monitor the situation.},

This article develops a revised NEP Scale designed to improve upon the original one in several respects: (1) It taps a wider range of facets of an ecological worldview, (2) It offers a balanced set of pro- and anti-NEP items, and (3) It avoids outmoded terminology. The new scale, termed the New Ecological Paradigm Scale, consists of 15 items. Results of a 1990 Washington State survey suggest that the items can be treated as an internally consistent summated ratingscale and also indicate a modest growth in pro-NEP responses among Washington residents over the 14 years since the original study.},

  Abstract                 = {Cities across the world have had to diversify and expand their water supply systems in response to demand growth, groundwater depletion and pollution, and instability and inadequacy of regional surface freshwater sources. In the U.S., these problems plague not only the arid Western cities but increasingly also cities in the Eastern portions of the country. Although cities continue to seek out new sources of water via Promethean projects of long-distance supply systems, desalinization plants, and the recharge of aquifers with surface water, they also pursue water conservation because of its low cost and other benefits. We examine water conservation as a complex sociotechnical system comprising interactions of political, sociodemographic, economic, and hydroclimatological factors. We provide quantitative data on the factors that affect more and less advanced transitions in water conservation regimes, and we show that water stress and other hydrological data can only partially predict the transition. We also provide qualitative case studies to identify institutional and political barriers to more advanced water conservation regimes. This interdisciplinary, mixed methods approach typifies the need for knowledge that informs hydrologists about how their research may or may not be adopted by decision-makers.},

The PDSI is a widely used drought index, yet the complexity and lack of transparency associated with the calculation of the PDSI makes it difficult for a researcher to independently calculate the index. Researchers are often forced to use PDSI values supplied by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or some other third party. The MATLAB tool presented here is easy to use, thoroughly documented, and transparent. The tool was developed by checking an independently developed code against NCDC's FORTRAN code. Discrepancies between the MATLAB tool and the NCDC code are documented. Researchers using the tool will be able to easily calculate the Palmer drought indices for data inputs of any length and at any spatial scale.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides the first willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates in support of a national climate-change policy that are comparable with the costs of actual legislative efforts in the U.S. Congress. Based on a survey of 2,034 American adults, we find that households are, on average, willing to pay between \$79 and \$89 per year in support of reducing domestic greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions 17 percent by 2020. Even very conservative estimates yield an average WTP at or above \$60 per year. Taking advantage of randomized treatments within the survey valuation question, we find that mean WTP does not vary substantially among the policy instruments of a cap-and-trade program, a carbon tax, or a GHG regulation. But there are differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of those willing to pay across policy instruments. Greater education always increases WTP. Older individuals have a lower WTP for a carbon tax and a GHG regulation, while greater household income increases WTP for these same two policy instruments. Republicans, along with those indicating no political party affiliation, have a significantly lower WTP regardless of the policy instrument. But many of these differences are no longer evident after controlling for respondent opinions about whether global warming is actually happening.},

  Abstract                 = {Anthropogenic-induced climate changes and population growth projected by 2050, combined with global economic growth driven by emerging markets, suggest that greater stress will be placed on water, food, and energy resources in the future. These resources are interdependent and are linked in a complex global network of trade. As pressures on the three resources grow, three-way interactions arise so that a solution to address scarcity in one cannot be achieved without impact on the others. The water security, food security, and energy security trilemma creates a multidimensional web that is a structurally complex network with dynamic links among resources that vary in both weight and direction. Because structure affects function, characterizing the network anatomy that links the resources in three-way interactions is helpful when setting goals to meet resource security. We argue that water plays a central role in shaping interactions and that the main scarcity issues occur with trade-offs between thermoelectric power generation and agriculture, between hydroelectric power generation and agriculture, and between biofuel production and food production. Three illustrations—the Apalachicola–Chattahoochee–Flint River Basin in the southeastern United States, the island nation of Sri Lanka, and Brazil—capture the main three-way interactions that we have identified. Although the problems that strew the path to global sustainability are massive, we suggest alternatives along both technological and nontechnological paths to meet future needs.

  Abstract                 = {Water and energy resources are interrelated but their influence on each other is rarely considered. To quantify the water and energy portfolios associated with a community?s water?energy nexus (WEN) and the influence of geographic location on resources, we present the WEN tool. The WEN tool quantifies a community?s transport (consumed for or lost before delivery) and nexus (energy for water and water for energy) resources so communities can assess their resource flows. In addition, to provide insight into the full range of impacts of water and energy resource acquisition and to frame the influence of geography on resources, we coin the term ?urban resource islands?. The concept of urban resource islands provides a framework for considering the implication of geography on a community?s water and energy resource acquisition and use. The WEN tool and the concept of resource islands can promote communities to think about their hidden resources and integrate such concepts into their sustainability trade-off analyses and policy decisions. In this paper, we use Tucson, Arizona, United States as a case study.},

  Abstract                 = {The New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale is the most frequently used measure of environmental concern, but it has not been placed in the context of a social-psychological theory of attitude formation or attitude-behavior relationships. Using data from a northern Virginia sample, this study examines NEP in relation to the variables in a theoretical model of environmental concern. We found that the NEP is indistinguishable from a scale of awareness of consequences (AC) of general environmental conditions, both psychometrically and in terms of its relations to behavioral intentions, but somewhat different in its relations to basic value orientations and sociodemographic variables. We conclude that both NEP and AC measure generalized beliefs about the nature of human-environment interactions-or "folk ecology"—a set of beliefs that may be influenced by social structure and values and that influence attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions regarding specific environmental conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes an improved edition of the climate division dataset for the conterminous United States (i.e., version 2). The first improvement is to the input data, which now include additional station networks, quality assurance reviews, and temperature bias adjustments. The second improvement is to the suite of climatic elements, which now includes both maximum and minimum temperatures. The third improvement is to the computational approach, which now employs climatologically aided interpolation to address topographic and network variability. Version 2 exhibits substantial differences from version 1 over the period 1895–2012. For example, divisional averages in version 2 tend to be cooler and wetter, particularly in mountainous areas of the western United States. Division-level trends in temperature and precipitation display greater spatial consistency in version 2. National-scale temperature trends in version 2 are comparable to those in the U.S. Historical Climatology Network whereas version 1 exhibits less warming as a result of historical changes in observing practices. Divisional errors in version 2 are likely less than 0.5°C for temperature and 20 mm for precipitation at the start of the record, falling rapidly thereafter. Overall, these results indicate that version 2 can supersede version 1 in both operational climate monitoring and applied climatic research.},

Our refined version also is dimensionless, but the limits have been recast so that $-1 \le I_m \le 1$. Wet climates have positive values of Im while dry climates are negative, and the index is symmetric about zero.
