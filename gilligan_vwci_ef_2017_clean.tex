\begin{abstract}
Urban water supply systems in the United States are increasingly stressed as
economic and population growth confront limited water resources.
Demand management, through conservation and improved efficiency, has long been
promoted as a practical alternative to building Promethean energy-intensive
water-supply infrastructure. Some cities are making great progress at managing
their demand, but study of conservation policies has been limited and often
regionally focused. We present a hierarchical Bayesian analysis of a new measure
of urban water conservation policy, the Vanderbilt Water Conservation Index (VWCI),
for 195~cities in 45~states in the contiguous United
States.
This study does not attempt to establish causal relationships, but does
observe that
cities
in states with arid climates and
higher partisan voting index (PVI)
tend to adopt more conservation measures.
Within a state, cities with large and rapidly growing populations and
higher PVI than the rest of the state
tend to adopt more conservation measures.
Economic factors and climatic differences between cities do not
correlate with
the number of measures adopted, but they
do correspond to
the character of the measures, with arid cities favoring mandatory conservation
actions and cities in states with lower real personal income favoring rebates
for voluntary actions.
Understanding relationships between environmental and
societal factors and cities' support for water conservation measures can help
planners and policy-makers identify obstacles and opportunities to increase the
role of conservation and efficiency in making urban water supply systems
sustainable.

\section{Introduction}
Cities face increasing challenges to their water supply because of complex
interactions among drought, infrastructure, population growth, land-use changes,
and other natural and human factors.
The prospect of climatic change adds to the difficulty of planning robust and
sustainable water supply systems, on account both of  increasing uncertainty
about future supply and demand for water, and also of predicted reductions in
water availability in some regions, such as the Southwestern United States
\citep{gcrp:natl.assessment.3:2014}.
For many years, advocates of soft approaches to managing water resources have
stressed the importance of improving  the efficiency with which society obtains
the water services it requires  \citep{gleick:soft.water.paths:2002}.
Some cities and their associated water-supply systems respond to these
challenges by pursuing grand energy-intensive infrastructure projects to draw
water from distant or difficult sources, but many have also shown increasing
interest in the soft path, managing demand through efficiency and conservation
measures, and a number of cities have made impressive progress
\citep{fleck:fighting:2016}.

A pressing challenge is to identify the characteristics of successful
transitions toward sustainable water use and the necessary conditions for those
transitions to spread more widely.
Studies have investigated urban water conservation policies and several water
conservation indices are available, but these either lack comprehensive coverage
of water conservation policies or are geographically limited
\citep{hess:vwci:2017,sauri:conservation:2013,maggioni:conservation:2014}.
Recent research finds that individual perception of water scarcity and
preference for policy action to address scarcity depend not only on the actual
degree of water scarcity, but also on the person's ideological worldview
\citep{switzer:green.lenses:2016}, but it is not clear how these individual
preferences translate into policy action.

The Vanderbilt Water Conservation Index (VWCI) is an integer score representing
the number of measures that a city has taken to reduce its water demand, out of
a list of 79 possible policy actions
\citep{hornberger:hydrological.transitions:2015,hess:drought:2016,hess:vwci:2017}.
This list includes 31 requirements, such as restrictions on
lawn-watering or mandatory use of water-efficient plumbing in new construction
and renovations; and 21 rebates offered for voluntary actions, such
as purchasing water-efficient appliances.
Previously, we assessed this index and performed preliminary quantitative and
qualitative analyses on a subset of the central cities of the 22 largest
metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the extended Southwestern United States
\citep{hess:drought:2016}.
That preliminary analysis found that propensity to
adopt water conservation measures depended both on characteristics
of the physical environment (precipitation) and on socio-economic and political
characteristics of the MSA (partisan voting and cost of living).

We represented the partisan political leanings of states and MSAs by the
Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI) \citep{cook:pvi:2013}. The index measures
the difference between the percentage of the two-party vote received by
Democratic presidential candidates in a city or MSA and the percentage received
in the national election. Positive or negative values measure the
city's or state's preference for the Democratic or Republican candidates,
respectively, relative to the national average.

Municipal water conservation policies are chosen by city officials, so it
may seem curious to measure partisan leanings with respect to presidential
elections. However, presidential votes have the advantage of providing a uniform
scale because voters across the country choose between the same candidates,
whereas the differences between Democratic and Republican candidates for
city and state positions vary considerably from one city or state to another,
with narrow ideological differences in some elections and wide differences in
others. Assessing partisan leanings in state and local
elections becomes more complicated and difficult when we consider that
the vast majority of American cities hold non-partisan city-council elections
\citep{svara:city.councils:2003} and more than one third of state-legislature
races are uncontested by one of the major parties
\citep{klarner:state.elections:2015,ap:uncontested:2006}.
Moreover, detailed vote
counts are not readily available for municipal- and state-level elections as
they are for presidential elections. For all these reasons, presidential
voting patterns are widely used to gauge regional variations in partisan
leanings.
Finally, we note that the rate of split-ticket voting has declined rapidly
and consistently since the late 1980s \citep{fiorina:renationalization:2016}
and that even voters who self-identify as independent are found to align
consistently with one party or the other \citep{hawkins:motivated:2012},
so we believe that
presidential votes are good indicators for comparing the partisan leanings
that voters bring to state and local elections across the United States.

% Two important economic indicators are
% Regional Price Parity (RPP) and Real Personal Income (RPI),
% which represent, respectively,
% the cost of living of a city or state, relative to the national average
% and the average personal income in the city or state, adjusted for cost of
% living and inflation \citep{bea:rpp.methodology:2016}.
% Our previous analysis examined RPP, but here we chose to examine RPI because
% we expected that the ratio of income to cost of living would be more relevant
% than cost of living alone.
%
Our previous analysis found that the PVI for an MSA had, by a large margin,
the greatest predictive power for adopting water conservation measures
\cite{hess:drought:2016}.
% , with RPP having the second-greatest predictive power.
The importance of PVI
was supported by qualitative analysis, which suggested that political
association of water conservation with general ``environmentalist'' politics
created political differences in the ways that cities respond to the physical
fact of water scarcity.

We subsequently expanded our database to the central cities in
197~MSAs in 47 states \citep{hess:vwci:2017},
which comprise more than half of the 382~MSAs in the United States
\citep{census:population:2015} and here, we present the first quantitative
analysis of the larger database, analyzing relationships between environmental
and societal characteristics of 195~cities across the contiguous
United States and those cities' propensity to adopt water conservation policies.
This analysis considers state-level as well as MSA-level variables. We identify
which variables
correlate most strongly with
variations in water conservation policy regimes,
how effects at the state level moderate city-level effects, and whether these
effects manifest differently when we consider specific aspects of
water-conservation policy, such as requirements and rebates.
%We find that differences in climate, political leanings of voters, and
%demographics are reflected in the number and kind of water conservation
%measures adopted by U.S. cities. Such insights
This analysis may help water managers and policy makers to anticipate how
receptive a given city might be to adopting different conservation measures.

\section{Data and Methods}
\label{sec:data.methods}

%The VWCI data set provides detailed information about both the number and
%nature of water conservation policies in n_all_cities ~cities in
%n_all_states~states  \citep{hess:drought:2016,hess.vwci:2017}.
The full VWCI data set provides detailed information about both the number and
nature of urban water conservation policies, which  allows hierarchical analysis
to examine the relationships between water conservation scores and
hydroclimatological and societal characteristics at both state and MSA levels.
Our complete database includes Anchorage, AK, and Honolulu, HI, but for this
analysis we chose to include only cities within the contiguous United States
(195~cities in 45~states,
Figure~\ref{fig:vwci_map})
because both
climatic and socio-political characteristics of Alaska and Hawaii may be very
different from those of the contiguous states, and also because state-level
variables that average over the enormous area of Alaska and across the multiple
Hawaiian islands may render them less suitable for our hierarchical treatment.

VWCI scores range from~3
to~53
with a mean of  18.7
and a median of 15
(Figure~\ref{fig:vwci_histogram}a; Table~S1).
The number of requirements ranges
from~0
to~23
with a mean of 5.6
and a median of 4
(Figure~\ref{fig:vwci_histogram}b) and the number of rebates ranges
from~0
to~15
with a mean of 2.7
and a median of 2
(Figure~\ref{fig:vwci_histogram}c).
%
% top_vwci table
%

The 20~cities with the greatest VWCI scores are in states in the
Western U.S., with the exception of two cities in Florida and one in New York
(Tables~\ref{tab:top_vwci}, S1). Cities with similar total VWCI scores, such as
New York and Salt Lake City vs.\ Tampa and Vallejo, El Paso vs.\ Miami, and
Riverside vs.\ Fresno, may have very different relative contributions from
requirements and rebates.

The relative contributions of rebates and requirements to VWCI varied
considerably (Tables~\ref{tab:top_vwci}, S1), and our previous qualitative research
indicated that there might be a preference for rebates over requirements in more
politically conservative cities \citep{hess:drought:2016,brown:politics:2016}.
Consequently, in addition to the VWCI score we also analyzed the number of
rebates and the number of requirements in a city's portfolio of conservation
policies.

\subsection{Explanatory Variables}
We obtained values for the MSA-level
monthly average
temperature ($T$) and monthly total precipitation ($P$) for the period
1900--2014
from the University of Delaware's gridded climate reanalysis
\citep{matsuura:gridded.temp:2015,matsuura:gridded.precip:2015}
and for state-level from the National Climatic Data Center's divisional
temperature and precipitation records for the Continental U.S.
\citep{vose:nclimdiv:2014}.
We calculated the mean annual temperature and precipitation over a
30-year interval from 1985--2014.
% PDSI was calculated from temperature and precipitation using a MATLAB software
% package by Jacobi \emph{et al.} and the historical drought severity was
% calculated as the longest run of consecutive years from 1900--2010 with
% $\text{PDSI} \le -3$ \citep{jacobi:PDSI:2015}.
We obtained populations for MSAs and states in 2010 and 2014
from the \citet{census:population:2015} and used them to calculate average
annual rates of population growth.
An important economic indicator is real personal income (RPI),
which represents the average personal income in the city or state, adjusted for
inflation and the regional cost of living \citep{bea:rpp.methodology:2016}.
We obtained RPI for MSAs and states in 2014
from the \citet{bea:rpi:2016}.
We obtained the
fraction of the public water supply taken from surface water sources
(henceforth, surface-water fraction) from the U.S. Geological
Survey's water use report for 2010 \citep{maupin:water.use:2014}.
We calculated the Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI)
using state- and county-level presidential votes, averaged over the 2008 and 2012
elections \citep{cook:pvi:2013,cq:elections:2016}.
Positive PVI indicates a greater Democratic vote share than the national average
and negative PVI a greater Republican vote share
(Tables~S1--S2 and Datasets~S1--S4).

We began with the covariates listed above, but adopted a modified set based on
preliminary results: The regression coefficients for $T$ and $P$ showed
collinearity.
This, together with a desire for parsimony, led us to replace them with the
K\"oppen aridity index: $P / (T + 33)$, with $P$ in millimeters and $T$ in
Celsius.
The K\"oppen index is
derived from mean annual temperature and precipitation
and correlates reasonably well with other aridity indices
that incorporate evapotranspiration
\citep{quan:aridity:2013}.
Larger values of this index correspond to wetter conditions
and smaller values to drier conditions.

The distribution of MSA population in~2014 was skewed, with
a few large cities producing an asymmetric fat tail (Figure~S1),
so we deemed the natural logarithm of population
a more suitable predictor
for a regression analysis \citep[pp.~59--61]{gelman:arm:2007}.

We tested for robustness by comparing this regression to
alternate regression analyses that used different predictors and different
prior distributions.

\subsection{Regression Analysis}
We applied Bayesian hierarchical varying-intercept
logistic regression to each of the
three conservation scores (VWCI, number of requirements, and number of rebates)
with the following explanatory variables: the K\"oppen aridity index, surface
water fraction, PVI, RPI, metropolitan population, and population growth rate.
The hierarchical structure of our regression model, which nests cities and MSAs
within states, reflects the fact that water resources extend beyond MSA
boundaries and that state-level policies affect local actions, both by
constraining local ordinances and regulations, and by encouraging or requiring
counties and cities to adopt various types of conservation measures.

The regression
analysis follows standard textbook treatments
\citep{gelman:arm:2007,gelman:bda:2014}.
Each city's conservation score (VWCI, requirements, or rebates) is
an integer count out of a maximum number of possible actions.
We model this as a quasi-binomial process, in which each policy action $a_j$
for city $i$ is
adopted independently with a probability $p_{ij}$.
In a pure binomial process, each policy in city $i$ would have the same
probability $p_i$ of being adopted.
However, the VWCI data was over-dispersed relative to a pure binomial
so our model uses a beta-binomial process,
which
allows for greater dispersion of scores by drawing the probabilities $p_{ij}$
for the different actions in city $i$ from a beta distribution with mean $p_i$
\citep[pp.~437--38]{gelman:bda:2014}.

We model the cities' mean probabilities $p_i$
with a hierarchical varying-intercept logistic
regression in which MSAs are nested within states and VWCI depends on both
state-level and MSA-level covariates.
For city $i$, located in $\text{state}_i$,
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{align}
\text{Score}_i \sim{}& \text{beta-binomial}(N_{\text{action}}, \phi p_i, \phi (1 - p_i)), \\
\intertext{where}
p_i ={}& \text{logit}^{-1}(y_i),\\
y_i ={}& \alpha_{\text{state}_i} + \textstyle\sum_j \beta_j x_{ij}, \label{eq:y}\\
\alpha_{\text{state}_i} ={}&
\alpha_0  + \textstyle\sum_k \gamma_k w_{\text{state}_i, k} + \delta_{\text{state}_i},
\end{align}
\end{linenomath*}
$N_{\text{action}}$ is the number of possible conservation actions
(79 for VWCI, 31 for requirements, and
21 for rebates),
$\beta$ is a vector of MSA-level regression coefficients,
$x$ is a matrix of MSA-level covariates,
% ($x_{i,j}$ is the $j$th covariate for city $i$),
% $\text{state}_i$ represents the state of city $i$,
and $\alpha_{\text{state}_i}$ is the intercept of the MSA-level regression
for all cities in $\text{state}_i$.
%and $\epsilon_i$ represents random noise at the MSA-level, which we do not explicitly model.
We do not include a noise term in Equation~\ref{eq:y} because random variations
related to the probabilities $p_i$ are incorporated in the beta-binomial
process \citep[p.~321]{gelman:arm:2007}.
The inverse logit function maps the real numbers onto the interval $(0,1)$,
thus transforming $y_i$ to a probability.
The overdispersion of conservation scores is parameterized by $\phi$:
as $\phi \rightarrow \infty$, the distribution of conservation scores approaches
a binomial distribution, and the smaller $\phi$ is, the greater the
overdispersion.

In modeling $\alpha_{\text{state}}$,
$\alpha_0$ is the mean intercept across all states,
$\gamma$ is a vector of state-level regression coefficients,
$w$ is a matrix of state-level covariates,
% ($w_{\text{state}_i,k}$ is the $k$th covariate for the state of the $i$th MSA),
and
$\delta$ is a random noise term that represents state-level variations not
accounted for by the regression model.
%$\sigma$ is a scale parameter for $\delta$.
We constrain $\delta$ to sum to zero in order to keep the model identifiable
\citep[Ch.~23]{stan:manual:2015}.

Standardizing independent variables to put them on a common scale serves both
to facilitate comparing the relative importance of variables whose natural scales are
vastly different
\citep[pp.~55--57]{gelman:prior:2008,gelman:arm:2007},
and also to improve computational performance \citep{stan:manual:2015}.
State-level covariates were rescaled to have means of zero and
standard deviations of 0.5.
Where the same covariate appeared at both the state and
MSA level,
we addressed multicollinearity between state-level and MSA-level
variables by rescaling the MSA-level covariate
to the same scale as its state-level counterpart and
subtracting the state-level value,
so that MSA-level covariate represented the difference between the MSA and
the state-average.
Covariates that only appeared at the MSA level were rescaled so
the mean over all 195~MSAs was zero and the standard deviation~0.5.

Because there are no previous quantitative comprehensive analyses of urban
water conservation policies, we represent our ignorance at the outset by
choosing weakly-informative priors, so the regression results are almost
entirely determined by the data, and are only weakly constrained by the priors.
We follow \citet{gelman:prior:2008}'s analysis
of weakly-informative priors for logistic regression
by choosing Cauchy priors with a scale of 2.5 for the
parameters corresponding to the standardized variables ($\alpha_0$, $\beta$,
and $\gamma$).
We represent $\delta$ as normally distributed
with a scale defined by the hyperparameter $\sigma$ with a positive half-Cauchy
hyperprior \citep{gelman:prior:2008}.
For $\phi$, we parameterized the Cauchy priors
\emph{ad-hoc}, based on the data, and setting the scales by trial and error
to make the prior distribution wide enough that it did not noticeably constrain
the posterior.
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{align}
\alpha_0, \beta, \gamma \sim{} & \text{Cauchy}(0,2.5),\\
\delta \sim{}& \text{normal}(0,\sigma),\\
\sigma \sim{}& \text{positive half-Cauchy}(0,2.5),\\
\intertext{and}
\phi \sim{}& \begin{cases}
\text{Cauchy}(50,20) & \text{for VWCI}. \\
\text{Cauchy}(15,10) & \text{for requirements and rebates}. \\
\end{cases}
\end{align}
\end{linenomath*}

We implemented the statistical model in the Stan probabilistic programming
language \citep{carpenter:stan:2016}, which generates a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
sampler.
We used R to prepare the data and call the sampler \citep{r.manual:2016}.
We
sampled four Markov chains for 1000 iterations each, after 1000 warm-up iterations,
which yielded a total of 4000 samples.
% where each sample is a vector containing a value for each of the model paraameters.
% These samples approximate random draws from the joint posterior probability
% distribution for the parameters, given the priors and the data,
% so the statistics of the samples approximate those of the
% posterior distribution.
The means and medians of the posterior distributions for
regression coefficients $\beta$ and $\gamma$, were equal within $\pm 0.01$
(Tables~S7--S9).
Code to reproduce the analysis is included in the supporting information.

To facilitate interpretation, we
follow the recommendations of \citet[pp.~81--82]{gelman:arm:2007} by reporting
rescaled regression coefficients:
\iffalse
$\beta' = N_{\text{action}} \beta / 4$ and $\gamma' = N_{\text{action}} \gamma / 4$,
which represent the approximate change in VWCI (or requirements or rebates)
\else
$\beta' = \beta / 4$ and $\gamma' = \gamma / 4$, which represent
the approximate change in the probability $p$
\fi
corresponding to a two-standard-deviation change of the covariate near the
midpoint of the logistic function (where $p = 0.5$).
The corresponding change in VWCI, requirements, or rebates is given by
$\beta' N_{\text{action}}$ or $\gamma' N_{\text{action}}$.

We tested VWCI for overdispersion by comparing binomial and beta-binomial models
using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO)
(Tables~S3--S4),
the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC)
(Tables~S5--S6),
and
visual
inspection of the distribution of posterior predictions of the mean, standard
deviation, maximum, and minimum of VWCI over the cities in our data
set \citep{gelman:bda:2014,vehtari:loo:2016}.
All three methods favored the overdispersed beta-binomial model.
These tests also strongly favored a
hierarchical
model over a single-level regression on MSA-level covariates.

We also considered a hierarchical varying-slope model, but with an average
of only 4.3 MSAs per state there were too
few degrees of freedom to adequately constrain 6
additional regression coefficients for each state.

\section{Results}
Regressions for VWCI, requirements, and rebates
(Figure~\ref{fig:vwci_cat_plot}; Tables~S7--S9)
all show
important correlations between PVI and
urban water conservation at both the state and MSA levels.
State-level aridity also correlates with
all three conservation scores.
Variations of aridity from one MSA to another within a state have a pronounced
correlation with
requirements, but
not with
VWCI and rebates.
At the MSA level, faster population growth and larger population
correlate
with higher values for all three conservation scores.
RPI and surface-water dependence
do not correlate meaningfully with the
conservation indices
at the state level,
except in the case of RPI and rebates,
and are negligible at the MSA level.
%
% vwci_cat_plot
%


States with greater (Democratic-leaning) PVI have
greater propensity
to adopt conservation policies, as do MSAs whose PVI is greater
(more likely to vote Democratic) than the rest of the state.
States with drier climates (lower aridity) also have
greater propensity for conservation.
MSAs with large and rapidly growing populations also
tend to score higher on all three measures.

For all three conservation scores, the largest
correlations
were for state-level,
as opposed to MSA-level, characteristics, but the posterior distributions show
considerable overlap so it is important not to over-interpret the ranking of
coefficients.

Two differences that stand out among the three measures are that state-level
variation in RPI and MSA-level variation in aridity
do not correlate meaningfully with
total VWCI and
correlate differently with
requirements versus rebates:
state-level RPI
correlates more strongly with rebates
than with requirements
and MSA-level variations in aridity
correlate more strongly with requirements
than with rebates.

\subsection{Robustness checks}
We chose our explanatory variables based on theoretical considerations, as
described by \citet{hess:drought:2016}. To test the robustness of our analysis,
we compared the results described above to three kinds of alternate regression
analyses for the VWCI
(See discussion of robustness, Figures S5--S6, and Tables~S3--S6
in Supporting Information).

First, we tested whether conservation policies might be more
responsive to recent extreme events, such as drought, by varying the
period over which we averaged the aridity index.
Second, we repeated the regression analysis substituting MSA population density
for the total population or including the MSA area and Gini index of income
inequality as additional predictors.
In all of these analyses, regression coefficients $\beta$ and $\gamma$
were consistent with the original model.
The information criteria were also consistent with one another.
In all of these analyses, the original set of covariates received the best
scores by a small and insignificant margin.

Finally, we tested for sensitivity to the functional form of the prior
distributions and found only small and insignificant changes when we
changed scales and replaced Cauchy priors for $\alpha$, $\beta$, and
$\gamma$ with normal priors.

We conclude from this that the results of our analysis are robust against
many changes of time-spans, explanatory variables, and assumptions about priors.

There are myriad other potential explanatory variables,
but we worried that exploring a large set of alternative models
and choosing the one that performs best might
unintentionally become an exercise in ``$p$-hacking'' due to
``garden of forking paths'' effects \citep{gelman:forking.paths:2014}.
Because of these concerns, we chose to confine our analysis to the original set
of variables, which we chose for theoretical reasons
\citep{hess:drought:2016}.

\section{Discussion}

This analysis identifies distinguishing characteristics of cities across the
contiguous United States that embrace water conservation policies, and allows us
to differentiate state-level from MSA-level effects. We find that water
conservation is associated both with characteristics of the physical environment
and with political and demographic
%, and economic
characteristics of cities and states.

Our previous qualitative analysis of the 22~largest southwestern MSAs suggested
that partisan differences over water conservation are more muted at the
MSA-level than at the state and national level \citep{hess:drought:2016}, but
while the quantitative analysis of that data showed that PVI played a large
role, it could not distinguish state-level from MSA-level effects.
Here, we find that for all three conservation scores (total VWCI, requirements
only, and rebates only), PVI is important at both the state and MSA levels.
The
correlation between
PVI
and the
three conservation scores appears to be
greater at the state level than at the MSA-level, but the posterior
distributions of state-level and MSA-level coefficients overlap too much to
permit much confidence in this ranking.

The state climate (aridity) shows clear
correlations
that are consistent across all three conservation scores.
The
correlations between
MSA-level aridity
and
VWCI and rebates are much
smaller
and consistent with zero.
We interpret this as reflecting the fact that urban water supplies often draw from
sources, such as river networks, watersheds, and aquifers, that cover large areas
and which may be shared by many cities and many categories of users.
However, aridity has a clear
correlation with
requirements, with cities that are
drier than the state average tending to adopt more requirements.

RPI measures the real purchasing power of per-capita personal income,
adjusted for inflation and regional variations in the cost of living
\citep{bea:rpp.methodology:2016}, and thus reflects prosperity.
At the state level, greater RPI correlates with lower conservation scores on
all three measures, but the
correlation with VWCI and requirements
is small and
consistent with zero,
whereas it is large and clearly nonzero for rebates.
Perhaps this reflects greater political support for choosing rebates over
requirements when households have less disposable income with which to pay for
conservation actions.
At the MSA-level,
correlations of all three scores with RPI
are negligibly small and
consistent with zero.

What emerges in the big picture is that cities in states with higher
(more Democratic-leaning) PVIs and more arid climates tend to adopt more
conservation measures, including more requirements and more rebates.
State-level RPI does not have a clear
correlation with
VWCI;
but when we look at the composition of policies, states with lower personal
income tend to rely more heavily on rebates.
Within a state, cities in MSAs with greater PVI than the state average and those
with large and rapidly growing populations tend to adopt more total conservation
measures, including more rebates and requirements.
Variations in aridity from one MSA to another within a state do not have an appreciable
correlation with
total VWCI, but
more arid MSAs tend
to favor requirements over other conservation measures.

\citet{brown:politics:2016} report on detailed interviews with decision-makers
from four cities, including San Antonio and Phoenix, which have the largest
and ninth-largest residuals, respectively
(Table~\ref{tab:vwci_top_residuals}).
This merits some discussion:
San Antonio has a low predicted VWCI in part
because of its low (Republican-leaning) PVI. However, federal policy may have
contributed to San Antonio having a much higher VWCI than predicted by our
regression: San Antonio's options for increasing its water supply are
constrained by the settlement of a lawsuit over endangered species, which
requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to restrict withdrawals from the
Edwards Aquifer \citep{brown:politics:2016}.
Phoenix has a much lower water conservation index than predicted.
One contributing factor may be the city's access to water from the Colorado River,
by means of the Central Arizona Project, which significantly relieves the
water stress that might be expected from the region's hydroclimatology
\citep{brown:politics:2016}.

One should be cautious about using using qualitative data based on historical
conditions to explain unusual observations or deviations from a model,
but these two examples illustrate the rich complexity of water conservation
policy and suggest that in future research, mixed-methods approaches
can be valuable, combining statistical analyses with detailed case studies
of selected cities to study both the patterns that represent what cities
have in common and the distinctive individual characteristics of different cities.

In comparing the findings of this analysis to those of our previous preliminary
analysis of the 22~largest MSAs in the Southwest, both studies identified PVI as
a very important predictor of water conservation policies, but with its much
smaller and less diverse sample, the previous study could not identify other
effects after controlling for PVI, and it could not quantitatively distinguish
state-level from MSA-level effects of PVI or other covariates. Here we observe
clearly that variations in both environmental and societal characteristics at
the state level are relevant to policy adoption; that within a state, variations
from MSA to MSA of PVI, population, and population growth are consistently
important; and that MSA-level variation in climate does not
correlate with
the number of conservation policies adopted, but
with
the kinds of policies adopted.

We emphasize that this study investigates associations and correlations, which
are not necessarily causal.
We only consider water policies at one point in time, which limits both our
ability to assess causality and to assess the effectiveness of the policies
at curtailing water consumption.
% Moreover, there is no good source for comprehensive longitudinal data on water
% consumption in U.S. cities, and this further prevents us from assessing
% the impact of these policies.
Thus, this study only considers the number of
policies cities adopt, and cannot speak to how effective those policies are.
We expect that extending this work longitudinally would provide a richer
understanding of conservation policy adoption and policy effectiveness.

\section{Conclusion}
An integrated perspective that draws on social science and natural science
variables shows that the adoption of urban water conservation policies cannot be
explained by considering only hydroclimatological factors, such as aridity and
the surface water fraction. Societal variables, such as political leanings, are
also important.

We find that correlations between
hydroclimatological variables
and conservation policies are greater at the state level than at
the MSA level, and that state-level aridity is the only hydroclimatological
variable whose effect is consistently clearly distinct
from zero across all the conservation measures.
PVI, on the other hand, is consistently important at both the state and MSA
levels.
Economic well-being has smaller correlations with policies, but
does correlate with the
categories of conservation policies a city is likely to favor.
These results suggest that large, rapidly growing, and more politically liberal
cities, and cities in arid and politically liberal states,
are
more likely to
adopt water conservation policies.

We conclude that policy
rationales for water conservation and proposals for specific conservation measures
would likely benefit from taking into account the complex mix of factors revealed
by integrated social and natural science research.

We also expect that further integrated interdisciplinary research along
these lines can produce a more detailed understanding of the number and character
of conservation policies that different kinds of cities are likely to adopt,
which would be relevant and useful for decision makers.

\caption{Scaled regression coefficients for VWCI, requirements, and rebates: $\gamma$ refer to state-level regression coefficients and $\beta$ to MSA-level ones.
%Coefficients are scaled  so the value on the horizontal axis represents the approximate change in the probability $p_i$ of adopting an action, corresponding to a  two-standard-deviation change in the predictor when $p_i$ is around 0.5.
For a scaled coefficient of 0.1, a two-standard-deviation change in the predictor corresponds to VWCI changing by about 8 for a city with a VWCI of around 40, the number of requirements changing by about 3 for a city with around 16 requirements, and a the number of rebates changing by about 2 for a city with around 10 rebates. The points represent the median of the posterior, the thick lines the 66\% highest-density interval (HDI), and the thin lines the 95\% HDI. Coefficients are grouped by state vs. city level and then ordered within each group by absolute value of the median for the VWCI analysis.}\label{fig:vwci_cat_plot}
